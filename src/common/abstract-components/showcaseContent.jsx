				Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
				population with some countries and entities actively fighting
				against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
				holding the fort.

				Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of
				tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with
				some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass
				adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far
				down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple
				words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into
				the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
				investment as is with other crypto currency project.{" "}

					We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did
					for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying
					digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard
					to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently
					being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give
					this space a real look.

				<span className="font-bold inline-block my-5">
					A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as
					powerful as countries and creators would be paid beyond the
					peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer.
				</span>
				<span>
					There would be new markets and advertisers with little to
					offer would not find home there. Like Kanye said,

						"Personalities would become the new currency, and
						services would be built on top of them".
					</span>
				</span>
				<span>
					Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like
					something we hope he would say.
				</span>
				<span className="inline-block my-5">
					Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now,
					but this time there would be no dead presidents on the
					money, there would people like you on the money, and you
					would own it because it would make the most sense in the
					world.
