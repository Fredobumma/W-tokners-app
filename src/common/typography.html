  Reimagining social media through the power of the blockchain.
</h1>
<p className="opacity-60 text-sm bigTab:text-base">
  We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and creators
  being able to launch their own digital currency by simply creating a profile
  with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens that can be owned and traded
  on the Tknrs network
</p>
<h3 className="font-bold text-28 leading-54 tab:text-32 desktop:text-4xl">
  For <span className="underline">Creators</span>
</h3>
<p className="opacity-50">
  Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital currency system
  that is dependent on growing and engaging with the community and also their
  star power. They own 10-15% of the total value of the tokens minted.

  What makes us different?
</h2>
<p className="font-bold opacity-60 text-sm bigTab:text-base bigTab:leading-5">
  We would only launch tokens with the express permission of the creators.{" "}
</p>
<p className="opacity-60 text-sm bigTab:text-base">
  There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok,
  Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we would be actively
  engaging before we go viral. We would get them on our platform and they would
  see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their digital
  content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary
  value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their
  digital currency across their channels while our native token holders benefit
  from the Weentar popularity.
